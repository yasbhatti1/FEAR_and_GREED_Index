# FEAR and GREED Index

For Risk analysis, we have created two different strategies, short term trading strategy and long term trading strategy. For the short term trading strategy, we will put on LSTM RNN Model hat to predict S&P 500 closing prices. We will also fetch todayâ€™s top business headlines to create business sentiments using Vader SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
For the long term trading strategy, we will switch and put on Random Forest Model hat to predict Recession. We will then wave our GradientBoostingClassifier wand to add some sparkle to our model accuracy. Finally, we will leverage Random Forest feature importances to create Fear and Greed Index to gauge the pulse of current market psychology (CMP) and showcase our results using Panel.
